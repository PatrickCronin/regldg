Compilation, installation, and documentation inforamtion:

Compile:
make

Install:
Don't; just run from here!

HELP! What do I do?
Point a web browser to ./docs/index.html.  All the documentation you should
need is there. Everything will work except the download link, and the "try it"
box on every page, unless you configure the variable $regldg in ./docs/tryit.php
to the regldg executable directory, and you have a PHP-enabled web server
running on your computer.

Enjoy!
